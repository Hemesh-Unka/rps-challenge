# RPS Challenge :fist::raised_hand::v:
**Makers Academy - Weekend Challenge 3**

Our third weekend challenge. We were tasked to build a small web application to simulate the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## Aim
After having trouble completing last weeks challenge, I wanted to keep this application as simple as possible. That meant doing tests first, coding and refactoring accordingly

I found that I was really comfortable this time around with what I was creating, and managed to achieve my goal of having a working solution before introducing styling.

#### To Do
- [ ] Implement Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard gameplay
- [ ] Fix RuboCop offenses with my code (5 offenses)
- [ ] Tidy up README
- [ ] Add domain modeling breakdown in readme
- [ ] Refactor code and tests as required
- [ ] In 2 player mode add a separate page so player 2 can enter there selection separately

## Task

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

## User Stories
